# keras-anomaly-autoencoder
Lightweight TensorFlow/Keras utility that augments a trained autoencoder with anomaly detection outputs.  It computes per-pixel reconstruction errors, normalized error maps, binary masks, and frame-level anomaly scores.  The goal is to make anomaly detection with autoencoders easier to use and interpret, especially for image-based tasks.
